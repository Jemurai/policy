## Security Program and Structure

### Security Policy

{{company_name}}’s security policy establishes its position on a range of security-related topics. While executive leadership is accountable for the execution of the program, the entire company works diligently to ensure that the security of our customers comes first. Our policies reflect our commitment to providing a trusted solution.

We understand that security due diligence includes reviewing company policies. While it is our policy not to share or distribute the {{company_name}} Security Policies, we are happy to share a summary, which reflects all topics covered in {{company_name}}’s data security program, and answer questions about its contents. The Security Policies themselves are internal documents containing confidential information on how we secure our customer’s data and conduct business operations.

### Alignment with NIST 800-53

{{company_name}} aligns its information security program to the NIST 800-53 framework. While {{company_name}} has not undergone an official audit, it maintains a mapping of controls against the ISO 27001 framework. Maturation of the information security program is driven by alignment to this framework and an understanding of any potential evolving threats.

### Independent Third Party Review 

{{company_name}} has partnered with independent security resources to ensure it is properly executing its security program. We believe that consistent monitoring of our platform through regular vulnerability assessments and penetration tests along with review of our policies, vendor management, and risk management programs is critical for our information security program. We rely on our relationships with security, compliance, and governance partners to ensure {{company_name}} is held to the highest standards.

### Security Training

{{company_name}}’s Security Training is a mandatory requirement for all employees. The training is structured to educate employees on the Information Security & Privacy Policies, provide an understanding of security in the context of our service and industry, instill the commitment to protect the security needs of our customers, and most of all, to ensure the safety and security of our customer’s data.

### Application Security

Application security is particularly important, because with applications running in the cloud, we know our cloud partner is responsible for infrastructure level security but we, through their Shared Reponsibility model are responsible for our application security.  To ensure that {{company_name}} follows best practices for application security, we train on the OWASP Top 10 and do both internal and external code reviews for security.

### Data Encryption

{{company_name}} secures all data in transit via TLS. Systems are configured to require the TLS protocol, meeting industry standards for externally facing systems. You can view an up to date assessment of our TLS configurations by visiting https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d={{company_name}}.com&latest.

Symmetric encryption (AES-256) is used to protect data at rest. This ensures that data is only viewable by authorized users.

### Data Access

{{company_name}}’s environment is highly-restricted by design. Access controls are in place to ensure that data is only available to appropriate parties. Internally, {{company_name}} employees may be granted access to the {{company_name}} platform for administration purposes only. 

### Data Processed by {{company_name}} Technology

To get the full benefit of the {{company_name}} technology platform, our partners must share very detailed and potentially regulated data.  We realize and understand that this is sensitive information and take our obligation to protect your data very seriously.  All personal data is encrypted in transit and at rest in our systems.

### Amazon Web Services and Complementary User Entity Controls

{{company_name}} is a SaaS solution hosted in Amazon Web Services.  AWS maintains a number of certifications at the infrastructure level including ISO 27001 and SOC2 Type II. While we take advantage of these offerings, we understand that it is our responsibility to secure the deployment of our systems and applications. We also understand that the security of our environment ultimately falls in our hands. We perform regular penetration tests and vulnerability assessments as well as configuration scans of our AWS environment to ensure that our use of AWS does not present unnecessary risk.
