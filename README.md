# Policy Template
This repository contains security policy templates that can be adopted by organizations of different sizes.

# How To Use the Templates
The easiest way to use the templates is to fork the repository and
keep your own working copy.  If you check back with Jemurai's main repository, you will be able to naturally pick up changes as our recommendations evolve.

We believe that there is a great value to keeping policy in github or a similar open system so that it is accessible and changes are tracked and easy to find.

Further, we recommend using pull requests to track *approvals*.  It is important to capture leaders' support for policy and approval of a pull request is one simple mechanism that can be used to track changes.

Some orgnizations will undoubtedly produce word documents or PDFs that will be circulated and handled differently.  That is also ok.

# Organization
How does the policy set work?  Every company has different needs.  The main policy set contained here on Master is a rich full set of policies that can be adopted by a fairly large and mature organization.  Look for branches for other specific policy targets like _startups in the cloud_.

In each case, there will be a _master_ policy that describes what other policies will be in place and how they should be used.

# Limitation of Liability
These policy templates are provided as a guide for what we believe are best practices.  *We cannot be responsible for whether the policy is complete or whether it is followed.*
