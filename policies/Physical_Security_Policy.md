{{company_name}} will not allow visitors to their data centers. In the event there is an exception to this policy,
{{company_name}} will track visitors in an electronic form that can be reviewed quarterly.

## Clean Desk

{{company_name}} has a general clean desk clear screen policy that applies in all environments. This means that
sensitive information including client documents, post its with passwords, etc. should never be left on desks or in
public spaces where others might easily copy them.

## Offices

### Company Offices

A Company Office is a dedicated, physically separate, and locked facility that is dedicated to Company business.  

Only current active {{company_name}} employees shall have access to {{company_name}} offices.  Keys to the office
will be tracked with assets.  See the Asset Management Policy.

{{company_name}} must implement reasonable security controls for any files or computer equipment commensurate with
the sensitivity of the data stored there.  This may include access tracking, locking cabinets and potentially locked
storage areas or rooms with specialized equipment.

If the Company Office stores customer data that is part of an online system subject to Business Continuity
considerations, it shall be subject to the physical controls outlined above for the Data Centers.

### Shared Office Space

{{company_name}} may use shared office space (co-working space). In these spaces, there are some different rules
from a dedicated Company Office.  Keys to the shared space must still be tracked.  Sensitive data (files or
computer equipment) must not be stored in the Shared Office Space, even if the space includes an office with
a door that locks.

Note that peripherals such as computer monitors or mice are not considered sensitive computer equipment.

### Home Office

{{company_name}} acknowledges that many employees may spend significant time working from a home office. There are
no explicit restrictions on how the home office must be secured, but the Clean Desk part of the policy applies.

## Audience

{{company_name}} employees need to be aware of the policy.
