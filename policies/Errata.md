## HIGH Impact Level Items

Since we aim to meet Moderate impact level, some controls are not required:

* [AU-10](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/AU-10)
* [SA-12](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/SA-12)
* [SA-13](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/SA-13)
* [SC-3](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/SC-3)
* [SC-21](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/SC-21)
* [SC-24](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/SC-24)
* [SI-6](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/SI-6)

## Gaps

Other NIST Items are unrealistic for small and mid sized companies to achieve.  The are as follows:

* [AC-16](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/AC-16)
* [MP-3](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/MP-3)

## CMMC Gaps

CMMC introduces a number of deeper and more advanced controls that simply aren't practical for small and mid sized companies.  They are included here as follows: 

* IR.4.101
* IR.5.106
* IR.5.102
* IR.5.108
* AC.5.024
* CM.5.074
* RM.5.152
* RM.5.155
* CA.4.227
* SA.4.171
