# Identity and Access Management Policy
The identity and access management (IAM) policy provides specific guidance around how access to resources shall be managed.

Identity is about how we know who a given person is.  Generally, this is handled by authentication to a specific system.

Access management is about how we manage which resources a person should have access to.

# Least Privilege


# Two Factor

# Single Sign On

# Password Complexity

# Deprovisioning Users
Jemurai shall leverage a single source of identity for as many operational systems as possible so that deprovisioning a user can be completed in one place.

Jemurai must keep track of resources that are not centrally managed and use a checklist to ensure that users are manually deprovisioned if needed.

Deprovisioning must be completed within two hours of the initiation request.  

# Audience
All Jemurai employees need to be aware of the IAM Policy.
