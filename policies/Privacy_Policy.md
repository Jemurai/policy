# Privacy Policy

This policy describes how we will handle information about any individual either internal or external that provides it.

## What Information We Collect

At Jemurai, we take privacy very seriously.  Many of us do not use major social platforms because we do not want our information shared or marketed.  Our aim is to extend the same level of consideration to our visitors and customers.

We work hard not to collect information in unsolicited ways.  We use Google Analytics and Stripe to collect general information about visitors and payment information.  When we collect personal information it is solely for the purpose of communicating more effectively with people that opt in to either purchase a product or service or to be notified about Jemurai events.  For those that provide contact information, we may follow up to build the relationship.  For those that do not wish to be contacted, we offer an opt out option here:  [google form](https://goo.gl/forms/XrVrVRH0HrNs9zjy2).

We assume that Google (Analytics), Stripe (Payments) and Amazon (hosting) collect additional information, such as IP address location, and browser information.  We only use this information as described above.

## Opt Out

Jemurai shall maintain an opt out process and check the opt out list on a monthly basis to ensure that the wishes of those that opt out are respected.

## Sharing and Transferring Your Information

In no case do we share information collected with third parties for the purposes of advertising or any other reason.

## Publishing The Privacy Policy

The Jemurai Privacy Policy shall be published to our web site for general consumption and awareness.

## Audience

All Jemurai employees need to be aware of the policy.
