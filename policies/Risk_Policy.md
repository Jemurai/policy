# Risk Policy

This policy describes how Jemurai will handle risk and risk management.

## Risk Program

There shall be a formal program to identify, track and manage risk.  Each identified risk shall be tracked in a risk register assigned to a specific management representative for handling and follow through.  Each risk identified shall be explicitly accepted or addressed.  The risk register shall track progress on action plans to address risk to ensure that identified risks get closed out.

## Threat Modeling

Jemurai shall maintain an active threat model which will be updated monthly.  This activity will help to proactively identify risks.

## Threat Intelligence

Jemurai shall make active efforts to compliment threat modeling with data analysis to identify real world threats that we face.

## Active Risk Identification and Tracking

Risks may be identified by employees or third parties as a one time observation or through a deeper assessment.

At Jemurai, a github issue shall be created in our policy project to track each risk.

Subsequently, each risk will added to the risk register so that overall handling and outcome can be documented.

In addition to detailed tracking, summary metrics shall be produced to support high level risk decisions.

## Laws and Regulations

Naturally, Jemurai must comply with pertinent laws and regulations.  At this time, the laws that apply to our business include:

* Employment related laws

## Compliance
