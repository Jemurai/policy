# Partner and Third Party Security Policy

This policy describes how {{company_name}} will handle partners, third parties, SaaS and service providers. [NIST800-53:SA-1](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/SA-1), [NIST800-53:SA-9](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/SA-9)

Note that acquisitions will be treated as Partners for the purpose of security and reviewed with the same process. [NIST800-53:SA-4](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/SA-4)

## Vendor Management Program

{{company_name}} shall implement a vendor management program where each provider will be tracked, access approved and reviewed quarterly.  This applies both to vendors like contractors that assist with internal company operations and vendors that supply SaaS or other solutions that {{company_name}} chooses to leverage.

Vendors shall also be re-evaluated when contracts or service delivery changes.  [NIST800-53:AC-20](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/AC-20)

Vendor security issues (breaches) shall also be explicitly tracked.

Vendors in turn will be asked to provide evidence of their security program and the security of their vendors.

To ensure that we adequately account for security, any major overall or project budget shall specifically include a line item for security.  [NIST800-53:SA-2](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/SA-2)

## Access to Data

Vendor access to {{company_name}} data shall be explicitly captured, tracked and approved.  Documentation shall be tracked.

Connections that share data with vendors / partners will be reviewed and approved.  

Data may only be shared with Vendors that can demonstrate that they have policies and procedures in place to protect the shared data, or such data sharing must be approved based on the nature of the data being shared (Tier 3 from Data Classification).  [NIST800-53:CA-3](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/CA-3)

## Audience

{{company_name}} engineers need to be aware of the policy.
