# Partner and Third Party Security Policy

This policy describes how we will handle partners and third parties.

# Vendor Management Program

Jemurai shall implement a vendor management program where each provider will be tracked, access approved and reviewed quarterly.  Vendors shall also be re-evaluated when contracts or service delivery changes.

The vendors shall be tracked in the [tracking sheet](../materials/vendor_tracking.csv).

Vendor security issues (breaches) shall also be explicitly [tracked](../materials/vendor_security_issue_tracking.csv).

Vendors in turn will be asked to provide evidence of their security program and the security of their vendors.

# Access to Data

Vendor access to Jemurai data shall be explicitly captured, tracked and approved.  Documentation shall be tracked in the vendor [tracking sheet](../materials/vendor_tracking.csv).

# Audience

Jemurai engineers need to be aware of the policy.
