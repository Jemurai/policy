# Acceptable Use Policy

This policy describes how {{company_name}} employees will be expected to use the resources we provide, including laptops, cloud resources, security tools and more.

## Personal Devices

It is acceptable for employees to use their personal smart phones for email and messaging.

It is not expected that employees use their personal devices for:

1. Storing any client data
1. Conducting security testing or code review
1. This includes personal Dropbox or shared storage devices

Additionally, personal devices should not be connected to the {{company_name}} internal network.  [NIST800-53:AC-18](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/AC-18), [NIST800-53:AC-19](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/AC-19)

## Company Devices

For the purposes of getting work done, {{company_name}} employees and contractors may be granted access to computers (laptops). Such computers are intended for use doing work for {{company_name}}. It is expected that these devices will be handled in a safe and secure manner to the extent possible. In addition, it is expected that these devices will not be used for unlawful activities or paid work for other entities.

## Cloud Resources

In the course of providing services, {{company_name}} employees shall have access to training resources and other cloud based services ranging from vulnerability scanning systems to CRM systems to shared storage
like Drive.  Throughout, employees are expected to use these systems in appropriate and intended manners.  Without exception, these systems should be tracked as part of the vendor management program as defined in the Partner Security Policy.

## Security Tools

{{company_name}} employees shall never use security tools provided at work for testing other 3rd parties without explicit approval.  Generally, the exceptions may be granted for volunteer activities but not for commercial arrangements.  In all cases, we will want a clear statement of liability to be in place.

All content shared with {{company_name}} employees is intended to be used internally.  Sharing or adapting internal {{company_name}} content with 3rd parties or for ongoing personal development outside of {{company_name}} is strictly prohibited.

Content can include training materials, templates, checklists and any other internally facing material.

## Sharing Data and Documents

With an increasing focus on cloud based document repositories, it is critical for employees to understand that direct access to {{company_name} documents or code artifacts should never be given to clients, partners or third parties except for under very specific circumstances and with the explicit approval of the security officer.
