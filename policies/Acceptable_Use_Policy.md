## Company Devices

For the purposes of getting work done, {{company_name}} employees and contractors may be granted access to computers
(laptops). Such computers are intended for use doing work for {{company_name}}. It is expected that these devices will
be handled in a safe and secure manner to the extent possible. In addition, it is expected that these devices will not
be used for unlawful activities or paid work for other entities.

Employees acknowledge that company devices likely contain data that is internal or secret and therefore any laptops
will be encrypted with FDE (see Data Classification Policy) and removable media will be securely erased between uses.
