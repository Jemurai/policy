# Business Continuity Policy

This policy describes how {{company_name}} will handle business continuity and disaster recovery.

## Contingency Planning

It is {{company_name}}'s policy to have a contingency plan and process
[NIST800-53:CP-1](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/CP-1) for how to track different systems and ensure that
they have the levels of availability that are required to safeguard the business.
[NIST800-53:CP-2](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/CP-2)  The team should be trained on the contingency
planning. [NIST800-53:CP-3](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/CP-3) The contingency plan should be tested.
[NIST800-53:CP-4](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/CP-4)

### System Availability

Systems and components that need to be highly available shall be identified.
[NIST800-53:PM-11](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/PM-11)  Any systems that are thought to require high
availability shall have an explicit plan for achieving such availability.  Such plans must include both processes
for achieving or restoring availability and metrics including explicit
[RTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery#Recovery_time_objective) and
[RPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery#Recovery_Point_Objective).
