# Systems Security Policy

This policy describes how systems security will be handled.

# Security Standards
Production server systems shall be help tdo 

# Vulnerability Scanning

As described in the [Network Security Policy](./Network_Security_Policy.md), vulnerability scanning will be performed at least quarterly.

# Patching
Unless otherwise identified, vendor patches shall be applied as soon as they are available.  

# DLP
Since DLP (Data Loss Prevention) solutions inherently involve monitoring user behavior and intercepting traffic or analyzing data in ways that inherently compromise security, we do not employ DLP solutions.

As an active alternative countermeasure, we offer training and clear definition of data classification measures.

# Antivirus

Although AntiVirus is a security standby, we will depend on Google Drive to scan any files we share internally.  We will not install AntiVirus on laptops.

# Audience

Jemurai engineers need to be aware of the policy.
