# Incident Response Policy

This policy describes how {{company_name}} will handle security incidents.
[NIST800-53:IR-1](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/IR-1)

## Handling

It is critical that {{company_name}} handle incidents and potential issues or breaches with the utmost care.

We recognize that the existence of a breach is bad.  We also recognize that poor response in the case of a breach can make it worse for our internal teams, our partners and our customers.

### Tracking

Every incident shall be tracked in a standard format in an incident tracker such as this [example](../materials/incident_tracker.csv).

On a weekly basis the tracker shall be reviewed by the acting security officer and any open unresolved issues acted upon and updated to reflect that work.

Note that incidents are expected to require emergency handling.  It is expected that any new incident be reviewed within 4 hours and triaged within 24 hours.

### Incident Handling

Incidents must be reported immediately to the security officer.  [NIST800-53:IR-7](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/IR-7)  The security officer should enlist external experts, delegate within the organization and develop an incident response team such that the organization's ability to respond to incidents is structured and repeatable.

Anyone internal or external can report a security incident by addressing an email to security@{{company_name}}.com, which will trigger an incident to be handled by the security officer.

Reporting incidents must include:

* Date and Time
* Description - without actual sensitive data
* Scope of Systems Effected
* Any Remediation Activities Already Underway

[NIST800-53:IR-5](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/IR-5)
[NIST800-53:IR-6](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/IR-6)
[NIST800-53:IR-8](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/IR-8)

### Training

Training shall be provided around incident response so that general employees and specialists responding know their roles and responsibilities. [NIST800-53:IR-2](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/IR-2).

## Internal Information Distribution

The distribution of information should be limited to the acting Security Officer and the Chief Executive.

Subsequent distribution and information sharing shall be limited to staff that need to know to help investigae or address the incident.

### Notification

Although notification laws may be in place with differing timelines, we aim to have aggressively open notification policies.  To that end, we will notify any 3rd party, client, vendor or partner effected by an incident within 24 hours of the incident and potential breach.

The security officer shall be on point in terms of the notification.

### Readiness

To ensure that we are prepared for escalating incidents, we will have the following in place:

* Law Enforcement Contacts
* Contacts with One or More Forensics Firms

In addition, we will have plans for how to respond to an incident and will conduct quarterly tabletop exercises to test incident response handling.  [NIST800-53:IR-3](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/IR-3)
[NIST800-53:IR-8](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/IR-8)
