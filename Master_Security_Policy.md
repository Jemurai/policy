# Master Security Policy
The master security policy outlines the main parts of how our security program works and draws from policy.  It describes who is responsible for policy, which policies are required, how and when they should be updated and what happens if they are not followed.

Anything that is common across all of our policies is captured in the master policy so that the top level rules are crystal clear.

Details about specific areas that may have a more directed audience are captured in those specific policies.

## Company Introduction and The Spirit of Security
As a *security* company, Jemurai takes security extremely seriously.  Our goal is to be explicit and clear about security whenever and wherever possible.

At the same time, we want to be agile and quick to adapt.  The policies herein are designed to allow us to find a balance between appropriate security measures for our employees, clients and partners - and a pragmatic solution that allows us to support our business interests.

## Policies and Procedures
Policies lay out the goals and principles of an organization.

Procedures are documented steps to repeatedly achieve a particular goal.  For example, there might be a procedure to install an application - or to harden a server.  A policy would state that servers must be hardened and patched.

In some cases, our policies may specify some explicit requirements or steps.  This is to reduce fragmentation of information and keep as much close at hand as possible.
